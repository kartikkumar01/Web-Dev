//Prototype - Prototype is an object associated with function constructors. Any properties or methods added to the constructorâ€™s prototype are shared by all instances created using that constructor via the new keyword.

function Person(name) {
    this.name = name
}

Person.prototype.sayHello = function () {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
};

const p1 = new Person("Kartik");
const p2 = new Person("Riya");
//***IMP*** : There are two problems that occur if we don't use (new) keyword over here:
//1) No new object is created , due to this, (this) will refer to the global object or undefined in case of use strict.
//2) The object will not be able to access the functions added inside the prototype.

p1.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Kartik
p2.sayHello(); // Hello, my name is Riya

console.log(p1.sayHello === p2.sayHello); // method is same as it is shared among instances

//Person.prototype is the prototype object.
//sayHello is a method added to the prototype.
//All instances (p1, p2) share the same sayHello function, saving memory.
//If you add methods to the constructor directly (this.method = ...), each instance gets its own copy, which is less efficient.
